<h2>
	Why we need to rethink monetary systems
</h2>

<p>If you are new to economy, you might first want to learn about how money is created in most of monetary systems.</p>

<p>Any Econ 101 course will do the trick.</p>

<p>For example, you may find the documentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200813001439/https://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=search_videos&amp;search_query=%22Money%2Bas%2Ba%2Bdebt%22%2C%2Bby%2BPaul%2BGrignon&amp;search_sort=relevance">"Money as a debt", by Paul Grignon</a>, informative.</p>

<h2>Libre currency is a new idea…</h2>

<p>The idea of a Libre Currency originated in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200813001439/https://en.trm.creationmonetaire.info/">The Relative Theory of Money</a>, a book written by french mathematician Stéphane Laborde in 2010.</p>



<h2>…but more than just an idea !</h2>

<p>It's more thant that!</p>

<p>A libre currency does exist. </p>

<p>It was launched in France on March, 8th 2017.</p>

<p>Its code name was originally Ğ1 and users now call it "jüne", or in phonetics: <em>\ʒuːn\</em></p>

<p>1700 individuals create their Universal Dividen (UD) on a daily basis.</p>

<p>They use their Ğ1 to exchange goods and services, IRL or via plateforms surch as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200813001439/https://www.gchange.fr/#/app/market/lg?last">ğchange</a>.</p>

<p>They use <a href="https://cesium.app/en/">the Cesium app</a> to send Ğ1 to each other.</p>

<p>
	Although the concept is difficult to explain to one's neighbough, the
	interest is increasing and the user base is steadily growing.
</p>
<h2>How we identify unique users</h2>
<p>Since each member of the Ğ1 produces money, we had to find a way to make sure </p>
<p>To assure one or many people do not </p>
<p>The Web of Trust</p>


<h2>The story behind The Relative Theory of Money</h2>

<p>In 2008, in the eye of the storm of the subprimes crisis, engeneer, 
chess commentator and mathematician Stéphane Laborde got an interest for
 the stock market and macroeconomy.</p>
<p>He read, amongst many books, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200813001439/https://www.ssa.gov/history/paine4.html">Agrarian Justice</a>, a pamphlet written by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200813001439/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine">Thomas Paine</a> in 1797.</p>
<p>At that time, Bitcoin had just emerged, and lots of alternative currencies were beginning to appear in video games and such.</p>
<p>He saw in cryptocurrencies an opportunity to invent a monetary system
 that would have clear rules, based on humans beings and physics.</p>
<p>Money couldn't be a store of value, as Aristotle wanted, simply 
because value evolve through time, and one generation's way to think 
about value might be really different from the next.</p>
<p>Money should be, for each generation, a non-biased way to mesure exchange, just life the meter is a way to mesure distances.</p>
<p>Money should not be a way for bankers to decide what the world should look like.</p>


<h2>The first libre currency is environemental-friendly!</h2>

<p>Most cryptos tend to be high consummers of electricity.</p>
<p>They may even have a high carbon footprint, since a large part of the global electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are disasters on the environemental part.</p>
<p>Ğ1 does not have these huge negative impacts, since we do not need the same Proof of Work Bitcoin and Ethereum do.</p>
<p>In Ğ1, only members of the Web of Trust (WOT) can verify transactions.</p>
<p>To take part in the verification of transactions, any member of the 
Web of Trust can install a Duniter node, that can run on a computer as 
small as a Raspberry Pi.</p>
